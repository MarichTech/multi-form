

Step1
Create a form
	-Give it an id
	-Do not assign any action to it
	-Add a function to the submit button
Create an IFrame div holder
	-Give it an id
	
(For any clarifications refer to multiple-action.html)


Step 2
Link the script.js file to the html file




The script.js contains all the logic and has detailed comments

For the demo I have used php
To test it out

Ensure you have an apache server installed(Either xammp or wammp)
Copy the multi-form folder to the htdocs
Start apache
open your browser and test it via http://localhost/multi-form/multiple-action.html
